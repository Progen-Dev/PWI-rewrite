# Progenwebinterface-rewrite

> PWI = Progen Web Interface

The new web interface from Progen is currently being reprogrammed. This is the repository of the new code. 


## What will be new?

- In the future you will no longer need a key generated by us but your discord account. This is easier and more secure.
- In PWI 2.0 we want to concentrate initially only on moderation and make it as visual and simple as possible. In the future, however, it is planned to make the entire offer controllable via PWI 2.0.

## Beta

But it will still take a while until the release. 
But we still plan to go into the first beta version soon. 
You want to help us to improve PWI 2.0? Then become a beta tester.
